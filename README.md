- is an ads and trackers blocker
- also an hosts file manager

There are so many different tracking companies to
track you and collect your online behavior data.
There is no way to be 100% not tracked online,
**Trackers Away** can help you to improve possibility to be untracked.

## Inspiration
The idea is from `AdAway` (an android ads blocker app), 
and StevenBlack's hosts list.
